Sample project for using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) unit testing framework,
by using its bindings from the [kodando-jest](https://github.com/danfma/kodando).
 
This example also shows how make `npm test` launch the tests (it's based on the jest sample).

Beware that current version of Jest doesn't work well when package.json is absent.
